- 👋 Hi, I’m @StinkyTruck
- 👀 I’m interested in hiking, biking, video games, and travelling
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I just really want to learn. Currenly my first project I'd like to start revolves around tracking public logistics data like ship/plane
routes and stops and starts. I would like to see how to extend that to trucking but I'm not sure where to get the information.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm not really sure how/what kind of communication is popular here
